        A Song

        I wish you were here, dear,
        I wish you were here.
        I wish you sat on the sofa
        and I sat near.
        The handkerchief could be yours,
        the tear could be mine, chin-bound.
        Though it could be, of course,
        the other way around.
        
        I wish you were here, dear,
        I wish you were here.
        I wish we were in my car
        and you'd shift the gear.
        We'd find ourselves elsewhere,
        on an unknown shore.
        Or else we'd repair
        to where we've been before.
        
        I wish you were here, dear,
        I wish you were here.
        I wish I knew no astronomy
        when stars appear,
        when the moon skims the water
        that sighs and shifts in its slumber.
        I wish it were still a quarter
        to dial your number.
        
        I wish you were here, dear,
        in this hemisphere,
        as I sit on the porch
        
        ...
